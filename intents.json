Add 1 to 2 ml of Planofix to every 5 liters of water and spray it twice every 15 days. This method can effectively reduce fruit drop. In addition, for fertilizing coconut trees, it is recommended that you use 25 grams of borax mixed with multiple trace elements for soil application. The dosage for each fruiting is 200-250 grams, and the dosage for non-fruiting is 100-150 grams, divided into two applications. By taking these measures, you can improve coconut palm inflorescence fruiting, increase fruit size, reduce fruit drop, and increase yields. This fertilizer comes in powder form and is ideal for fertilizing coconut trees."

Crop yield-increasing agents contain a variety of trace elements, such as iron, zinc, manganese, etc., which can provide the nutrients needed for eggplant growth. By regularly spraying crop yield enhancer solution, you can improve the growth of eggplants and increase yield and quality. In addition, you can further improve the growth of eggplants by keeping the soil moist and controlling pests and diseases. Remember to use the appropriate amount of crop yield enhancer according to the product instructions to avoid excessive use that may have adverse effects on eggplants."

Use Bavistin: Spray Bavistin solution with 3 grams/liter of water at the base of the diseased plant, which can effectively inhibit the growth and spread of the bacteria.\n2. Transplant disease-resistant varieties: Choosing banana varieties resistant to Panama wilt for transplanting can reduce the occurrence and spread of the disease.\n3. Treatment of diseased plants: Find and treat infected diseased plants in a timely manner, remove and destroy them to prevent the spread of germs to other healthy plants.\n4. Soil management: Maintaining soil ventilation and drainage and avoiding stagnant water and overly humid conditions will help reduce the occurrence of Panama wilt.\nBy taking these measures, Panama wilt can be effectively controlled and the healthy growth of banana plants protected."
